                <p>Staking pools organize independent NU holders to act as a single Staker in the NuCypher protocol.
                Participants deposit their NU into the pool and pool operators run a Worker node on
                behalf of the entire pool.</p>

                <p>Proceeds for each participant is calculated pro-rata based on their share
                of the NU deposited in the pool. Pool participants don't need to worry about running a worker node
                or the associated gas cost, but pool operators typically charge a percentage of staking rewards as a service fee.</p>

                <p>Anyone looking to deploy and run their own staking pool can do so via the <a target="blank" href="https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/architecture/staking_contracts.html#staking-pool-contract">NuCypher Staking Pool Contract.</a>
